# SOC Automation Homelab Project

## Introduction
This repository documents my journey in creating a SOC Automation Homelab, inspired by the MyDFIR's tutorial series. The project's goal is to set up a comprehensive Security Operations Center (SOC) with Wazuh instance, SOAR integration, and TheHive for case management.

## Project Overview
The SOC Automation Homelab is designed to provide practical experience in cybersecurity operations. It involves:
- Setting up a Wazuh instance for security monitoring.
- Integrating SOAR for streamlined incident response.
- Implementing TheHive for effective case management.
